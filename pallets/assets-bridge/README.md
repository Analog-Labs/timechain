# DEMO 
## Set Up

### TC 

Start TC

``` sh
scripts/build_docker.sh
docker compose --profile bridge up -d
```

### GMP

Deploy gateways

``` sh
docker compose run --remove-orphans tc-cli --config local-evm-bridge.yaml deploy
```

Register TC network (route) to the gateway at network `2`:

``` sh
docker compose run --remove-orphans tc-cli --config local-evm-bridge.yaml set-tc-route 2 0x49877F1e26d523e716d941a424af46B86EcaF09E
```

Register shard for the network `2`:
    
``` sh
docker compose run --remove-orphans tc-cli --config local-evm-bridge.yaml register-shards 2
```

### ERC20 

We use `AnlogTokenV2` from **Analog-Labs/erc20-token** [`bridge`](https://github.com/Analog-Labs/erc20-token/tree/bridge) branch.

Run tests 

``` sh
cd ../erc20-token
forge clean && forge test
```

Build contract 

``` sh
forge clean && forge build
```

We'll deploy it to network `2` which should have RPC exposed at `8545` port:

1. Find out chronicle's address on target network 

``` sh
docker compose run --remove-orphans tc-cli --config local-evm-bridge.yaml chronicles
```

And save it to env var:

``` sh
# Set this to chronicle's address 
export MINTER=0xC969dEa46d374E26A9f60A6A71c3Fe186050F35F
```

2. Set env vars 

   ```sh 
# well-known (thus key compromised) Anvil default account(0)
export DEPLOYER=0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
# well-known (thus key compromised) Anvil default account(2)
export UPGRADER=0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC
# well-known (thus key compromised) Anvil default account(3)
export PAUSER=0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906
# well-known (thus key compromised) Anvil default account(4)
export UNPAUSER=0x15d34AAf54267DB7D7c367839AAf71A00a2C6A65
export GATEWAY=0x49877F1e26d523e716d941a424af46B86EcaF09E
```

3. Deploy `V1`
(provide the well-known key of `account(0)` of anvil)

``` sh
forge script script/00_Deploy.V1.s.sol --rpc-url="http://localhost:8545" --broadcast -i 1

### Bridge Pallet 

Register a new (or update an existing) network for teleportation at bridge pallet: 

call `bridge/register_network extrinsic` (or `force_update_network`) from sudo with following parameters:

+ network: `2`
+ baseFee: 0
+ data:
  + nonce: 0                         
  + dest: `0x0000000000000000000000009fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0` (address of our ERC20 contract (proxy), zero-prefixed to match 32bytes size)

## Flow 

### TC -> ERC20 

Let's teleport some ANLOG to `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` address.

Check that it has zero ANLOG first: 

``` sh
cast call $PROXY "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
0
```

Send teleport_keep_alive extrinsic from any account having ANLOG (e.g. `//Eve`):

+ network_id: `2`
+ beneficiary: `0x000000000000000000000000f39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`
+ amount: 15000000000000

You should see `bridge.Teleported` event emitted, as well as `task.TaskCreated`, note task_id from it for tracking. 

You can track task status with 

``` sh
docker compose run --remove-orphans tc-cli --config local-evm-bridge.yaml task 13
```

Also, you can monitor tx_hash for the corresponding transaction on the target chain, by getting msg index from the command above, and then querying `batchTxHash` storage of the pallet_tasks.

Once task is successfully completed, ANLOG tokens should have been teleported to target account. 
Let's check that on network `2`:

``` sh
cast call $PROXY "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
15000000000000
```

We can see that the requested amount is successfully teleported.

### ERC20->TC 

Let's now teleport some ERC20 back to TC, to `//Alice` account. 

All you have to do for that is to call [`teleport(bytes32 to, uint256 value)`](https://github.com/Analog-Labs/erc20-token/blob/a93214a85e46a23c127574652e9ec424f5f33c3f/src/AnlogTokenV1.sol#L188) method of our token contract.

First we note current Alice balance in TC, (e.g. is `free: 1,001,000,033,212,589,939` MANLOG).

Then we need to figure out GMP cost for the teleportation message:
``` sh
cast call $PROXY "estimateTeleportCost()" | cast 2d
181255
```

Then we send the teleport tx: 

``` sh
cast send --from 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 --unlocked --value 181255 $PROXY "teleport(bytes32,uint256)" 0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d 6000000000000
```

here we provide: 

+ 181255 (*10^-18) ethers as a payment for GMP message passing thru gateway 
+ `teleport(bytes32,uint256)` args:
  + Alice's public key on TC (hex-encoded)
    this can be queried with `subkey Alice //inspect`
  + Amount to be teleported 

You can see the tx result and block number as the command's output. Note that block number, once events from the block are reported to TC by chronicle, 
Alice should get the teleported `6` ANLOG to her TC account. 

### Troubleshooting 

1. If you see task as "completed", but tokens are not delivered to dest network: 
   1. Note batch_id of the task: It's x in `SubmitMessage(x)` which you see w `tc-cli task x`;
   2. Query [GmpStatus](https://github.com/Analog-Labs/analog-gmp-examples/blob/00090ef5b83574c5fdaa2a10d428f87e1702cc79/examples/teleport-tokens/BasicERC20.sol) of the message  via querying `gmpInfo(bytes32)` on the gateway:
      
      !note: even if tc-cli report task status as __completed_, message itself could have been reverted. 
      To check actual message status run: 
      ```sh
      cast call 0x49877F1e26d523e716d941a424af46B86EcaF09E "gmpInfo(bytes32)" <msg_id>
      ``` 
   2. Query GMP message tx_hash by batch_id from tasks pallet storage: `batchTxHash(u64)`;
   3. Re-run that tx with trace: 
      `$> cast run <tx_hash>`;
   This will show you tx execution trace
